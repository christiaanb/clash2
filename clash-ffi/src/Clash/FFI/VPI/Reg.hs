-- | A register is a VPI object that is known to refer to something with the
-- @vpiRegister@ object type.
--
-- Registers can be unsafely created from 'Object', although this is only safe
-- if you first check the @vpiType@ property to confirm it is a register.
-- Registers can be safely converted to the base object type using
-- 'regObject'.
