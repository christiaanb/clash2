-- | A VPI iterator is created to traverse a one-to-many relationship between
-- objects in a design. Iterators can be used in two different ways:
--
--   * Creating an iterator with 'iterate' and manually stepping with 'scan'.
--     This is similar to how iterators are used in C, with the caller being
--     responsible for freeing the iterator with 'freeObject' if it is not
--     fully traversed.
--
--   * Creating an iterator and fully traversing it with 'iterateAll'. This
--     fetches all elements of the iterator at once, which automatically frees
--     the iterator.

-- | Create an iterator for objects of the given type under the specified
-- parent object. If no parent object is given, the iterator iterates over
-- the top-level of the design.
--
-- If this iterator is not fully traversed with 'scan', then it needs to be
-- manually freed with 'freeObject'.
