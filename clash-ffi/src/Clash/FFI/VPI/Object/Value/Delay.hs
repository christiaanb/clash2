-- | The delay mode specifies how the value of an object is updated in a call
-- to @vpi_put_value@. The mode selected influences how the next value of the
-- object is determined (in the event of multiple attempted writes per step).
--
data DelayMode
  = NoDelay
  -- ^ The value is immediately updated.
  | InertialDelay Time
  -- ^ The value is updated after all events at the given time are executed.
  | TransportDelay Time
  -- ^ All scheduled events that occur later than the given time are removed
  -- and the value is updated.
  | PureTransportDelay Time
  -- ^ No scheduled events are removed and the value is updated.
  | Force
  -- ^ The object is forced to the new value without delay. This behaves the
  -- same as the verilog procedural @force@ keyword.
  | Release
  -- ^ The object is released from a forced value, then updated to the new
  -- value without delay. This behaves the same as the verilog procedural
  -- @release@ keyword.
