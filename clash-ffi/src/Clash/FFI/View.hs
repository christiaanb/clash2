-- | A class for data with raw values which can be unsafely sent over the FFI.
-- It may be desirable to send values unsafely, as unsafe sending allows data
-- to be sent without needing to create a new copy. Callers are responsible for
-- making sure that data is never unsafely sent to a VPI function which takes
-- ownership of a pointer, as any modification to this value will silently
-- modify the original value, potentially corrupting the Haskell RTS state.

-- see 'Receive' and 'UnsafeReceive'.

-- If the data being sent is never mutated by the FFI, consider using
