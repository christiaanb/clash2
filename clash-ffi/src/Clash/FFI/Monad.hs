NOTE [continuation-based API]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For clash-ffi, the API is designed around a continuation monad. The reason for
this is that we want control over allocated memory, but cannot use `ForeignPtr`
as we do not own a lot of the allocated memory.

We could have stayed in IO directly, however the API given in `base` can
quickly become burdensome to read and write, since `alloca` has the type

  alloca :: Storable a => (Ptr a -> IO b) -> IO b

which can lead to an excess of nesting in functions. Using continuations we
can provide a more consistent API where stack and heap pointers are used in the
same way, e.g.

  do
    x <- stackPtr
    y <- heapPtr
    result <- f x y

    freePtr y
    pure result

-- | The type of FFI actions with an input @i@ and an output @o@. For arbitrary
-- actions to be run in FFI, the type will be @SimCont o A@, where @A@ is the
-- result of the action (since this API is continuation-based the output of
-- one action is the input to the continuation).
--
-- For the "main" action performed by @clash-ffi@, there is no input and no
-- output. The 'SimAction' synonym is intended for this case. Consequently,
-- there is no @runSimCont@ function, as actions should be run with
-- 'runSimAction'.
