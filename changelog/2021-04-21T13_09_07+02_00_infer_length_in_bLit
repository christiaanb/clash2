CHANGED: `bLit` now infers the size of the generated BitVector from the string given to it. This means you don't have to give it an explicit type signature anymore. This does slightly modify the syntax needed to invoke `bLit`. E.g., `$$(bLit "00..1") :: BitVector 5` should be rewritten as `$(bLit "00..1")`. If you relied on the size inference, wrap the new invocation in `resize`. For example: `resize $(bLit "00..1")`.
