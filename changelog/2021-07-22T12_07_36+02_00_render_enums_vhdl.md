CHANGED: Clash now renders ADTs with all zero-width fields as enumerations in VHDL.

This makes generated code easier to follow, as more user-specified names are
preserved in the final HDL. For types like

```haskell
data TrafficLight = Red | RedAmber | Amber | Green
```

VHDL which performs case analysis will now render something more like

```vhdl
with x select
  y <= z_1 when TrafficLight'(Red),
       z_2 when TrafficLight'(RedAmber),
       z_3 when TrafficLight'(Amber),
       z_4 when others;
```

instead of

```vhdl
with x select
  y <= z_1 when "00",
       z_2 when "01",
       z_3 when "10",
       z_4 when others;
```

Code which uses custom representations will continue to render `std_logic_vector`
as before, as will code generated in (System)Verilog.

The old behaviour (always rendering std_logic_vector) can be recovered by using
the new -fclash-no-render-enums flag.
