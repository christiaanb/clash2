FIXED: Make `satSucc`, `satPred` work correctly for small instances.
`satSucc` and `satPred` are moved to the class `SaturatingNum`. The default
methods assure existing code keeps working. For types where small instances
cannot express the number 1, i.e., `Index`, `Signed` and `Fixed`, an
alternative implementation assures correct behavior nonetheless.
