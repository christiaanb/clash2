CHANGED: `Clash.Explicit.Testbench.outputVerifier` and `outputVerifierBitVector` now emit a warning if they are used improperly. This situation only arises when they are used in synthesized code rather than a test bench context. When the clock domains `circuitDom` and `testDom` are two different domains, the clock crossing inside `outputVerifier` is only suitable inside a test bench, not inside a synthesized circuit. Clash now emits a warning for this case.
