ADDED: A new clock type `DiffClock` is introduced to signify a differential
clock signal that is passed to the design on two ports in antiphase. This is
used by the Xilinx `clockWizardDifferential` IP generator.

CHANGED: Xilinx `clockWizardDifferential` now gets its input clock as a
`DiffClock` type; use `seClockToDiffClock` to generate this in your test bench
if needed. Previously, the function received two clock inputs, but this
generated `create_clock` statements in the top-level SDC file for both phases
which is incorrect.
