ADDED: `Clash.DataFiles.tclConnector` and the executable `static-files` in
`clash-lib`. They provide the Tcl Connector, a Tcl script that allows Vivado to
interact with the metadata generated by Clash (Quartus support will be added
later). See `Clash.DataFiles.tclConnector` for further information. More
documentation about the Tcl Connector and the Clash<->Tcl API will be made
available later.
