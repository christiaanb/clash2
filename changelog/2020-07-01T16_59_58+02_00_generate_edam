CHANGED: Clash now generates EDAM for using Edalize

This generates edam.py files in all top entities with the configuration for
building that entity. Users still need to edit this file to specify the EDA
tool to use, and if necessary the device to target (for Quartus, Vivado etc.)
These sections are marked with TODO.
