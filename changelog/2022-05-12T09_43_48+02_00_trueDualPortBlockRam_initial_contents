CHANGED: the `trueDualPortBlockRam` function now accepts a vector containing the
initial block-RAM contents.
ADDED: the function `trueDualPortBlockRamU` function was added which which
initialises all RAM content to an undefined value. This is the same behaviour as
the `trueDualPortBlockRam` function had before this change.
