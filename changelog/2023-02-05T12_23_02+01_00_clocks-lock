FIXED: The Haskell simulation of the PLL lock signal in `Clash.Clocks` (used by
`Clash.Intel.ClockGen`) is fixed: the signal is now unasserted for the time the
reset input is asserted and vice versa, and no longer crashes the simulation.
HDL generation is unchanged. The PLL functions now have an additional
constraint: `KnownDomain pllLock`.
