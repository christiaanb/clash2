REMOVED: Dropped the snap package

The Clash snap package has not been a recommended way to use Clash for quite
some time, and it is a hassle to support.

In order to build a snap package, we build .deb packages for Clash with Ubuntu
20.04 LTS. But the interaction between the Debian build system and GHC is
problematic, requiring significant effort to support and to upgrade to a more
recent Ubuntu release.

Additionally, snap packages have their own issues on distributions other than
Ubuntu. Given that we no longer recommend people use our snap package and
given the effort required to keep supporting them, we have decided to drop the
snap package.
