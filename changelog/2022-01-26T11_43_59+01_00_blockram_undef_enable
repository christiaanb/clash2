FIXED: `Clash.Explicit.BlockRam.blockRam#` and `Clash.Explicit.BlockRam.File.blockRamFile#` Haskell simulation incorrectly treated an _undefined_ write enable as asserted. It now causes an _undefined_ value to be written instead. This problem did not propagate to the other `blockRam` functions, where the same condition would simultaneously lead to an undefined write address, which would be handled correctly. This problem also only affects Haskell simulation, not the generated HDL.([#2054](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/pull/2054))
