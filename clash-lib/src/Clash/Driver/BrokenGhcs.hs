  Clash has known issues on #{major0}.#{major1}.#{patch} on your current
  OS. While not completely preventing the compiler from working, we recommend
  switching to another GHC version. Symptoms:

    #{what}

  Consider the following work around or solution:

    #{solution}

  More information can be found at:

    #{issue}

  If you want to ignore this message, pass the following flag to Clash:

    -fclash-ignore-broken-ghcs

  Alternatively, you can set the environment variable CLASH_IGNORE_BROKEN_GHCS
  to 'True'.
